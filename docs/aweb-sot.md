# aweb — Source of Truth

This is the canonical contract for **aweb**: the OSS coordination
server (Python FastAPI) and the `aw` CLI (Go). It defines the
shape of every endpoint, schema, authentication mechanism,
dependency, and configuration knob aweb exposes or relies
on. Implementers build against this document; operators run aweb
against the contract it defines here.

awid (the public identity registry that aweb depends on) is described
in [`awid-sot.md`](awid-sot.md). The public hosted instance of aweb
runs at <https://app.aweb.ai>; anyone can self-host the same OSS server
against any awid registry.

For supporting reference material that does not redefine the contract:
- [`cli-command-reference.md`](cli-command-reference.md) — full `aw`
  CLI surface, generated from the live Cobra help tree
- [`mcp-tools-reference.md`](mcp-tools-reference.md) — MCP tool
  inventory and parameters exposed by aweb's MCP server
- [`self-hosting-guide.md`](self-hosting-guide.md) — operator runbook
  for the OSS stack
- [`identity-key-verification.md`](identity-key-verification.md) —
  normative rules for verifying `GET /v1/did/{did_aw}/key` responses
- [`global-local-identity-routing.md`](global-local-identity-routing.md) —
  supporting SOT for the shipped route-level global/local messaging contract
  and the legacy reachability/conversation-auth cleanup path
- [`product-authority-sot.md`](product-authority-sot.md) — supporting SOT for
  identity custody, addressability, team authority, runtime hosting, app
  portability, and the supported terminal/browser composition paths
- The aweb server's REST API is documented by the live FastAPI
  `/docs` OpenAPI viewer, auto-generated from route signatures.
  There is no hand-maintained `server-api-reference.md` — a previous
  version was deleted as stale drift and should not be recreated.
  Any future need for a human-readable API reference should be
  satisfied by pointing at the `/docs` endpoint.

## Principles

1. **awid owns identity and serves verification primitives for team
   membership** (team public keys and revocation list). Cert holders
   carry their own certificates and present them to any verifier. aweb
   never creates, stores, or manages identities. It never decides who
   is in a team — it verifies presented certs against the team's public
   key + revocation list.
2. **aweb owns coordination.** Mail, chat, issues, roles, locks,
   workspaces, events. This is the only thing aweb does.
3. **Team certificates are the single credential for coordination
   endpoints.** Agents authenticate every coordination request (mail,
   chat, issues, roles, locks, instructions, workspace state) with a
   DIDKey signature and a team certificate. aweb's MCP server uses the
   same team certificate auth on its local CLI mount. Hosted operators
   may layer additional auth modes (OAuth, opaque bearer tokens, etc.)
   on top of their own MCP surface, but those are operator-specific
   and outside the aweb OSS contract.
4. **team_id is the coordination scope for non-messaging state.** Issues,
   claims, locks, roles, instructions, and presence are scoped to a
   `team_id` (e.g., `backend:acme.com`). **Messaging is
   identity-scoped, not team-scoped.** First contact to a global recipient uses
   a concrete address route (`domain/name`); continuations use stored
   participant route state. Delivery succeeds or fails based on the recipient's
   explicit `inbound_mode`: teams are not the routing scope for delivery, but
   verified same-team membership is delivery authority when the recipient uses
   `team_and_contacts`. See the Messaging section below for the full model.

## Concepts

This section defines the conceptual taxonomy that the rest of the document
operates on: agent vs workspace vs identity vs alias vs address. These
distinctions are load-bearing — collapsing them into a single "agent =
identity = address" notion would muddle the routing, trust, and lifecycle
stories the rest of the spec depends on.

### Agent

An **agent** is a running participant.

- A local CLI runtime is an agent.
- A hosted OAuth MCP runtime is an agent.
- An agent uses exactly one identity at a time.
- An identity may be inactive even when no agent is currently running under it.

### Workspace

A **workspace** is a local runtime container.

- It is represented by a local `.aw/` directory.
- It stores local runtime state and configuration.
- It may also store secret key material for self-custodial global identities.
- A workspace belongs to one local machine/path, but it may be moved by moving
  the `.aw/` directory.
- A workspace has one active identity and one active team binding.
- Hosted OAuth MCP runtimes do **not** have a local workspace.

A workspace is bound to exactly one team. An agent that needs to
participate in multiple teams uses multiple workspaces (typically
multiple git worktrees), each with its own `.aw/` directory and its own
team certificate. The certificate format does not preclude an agent
identity (`did:key`) from being a member of more than one team — multi-
team agents are a future capability the cert format already accommodates
— but the v1 CLI and server bind one workspace to one team.

### Identity

An **identity** is the principal the agent uses for messaging, coordination,
and trust.

Two identity classes exist:

- **Local identity**: disposable, internal, one alias. Has only `did:key`.
  Created by accepting a team invite or via spawn into the same team. Deleted
  when the workspace is removed. Does not carry public trust continuity.
- **Global identity**: durable, trust-bearing. Has both `did:key` and
  `did:aw`. Has one or more public addresses. Supports rotation, archival, and
  controlled replacement.

Trust continuity is only promised for global identities.

### Custody Modes

Global identities have two custody modes:

- **Self-custodial**: the agent holds its own Ed25519 private key locally,
  inside its `.aw/` workspace. Created only from the CLI. Cannot be used by
  hosted OAuth MCP runtimes. Created explicitly via `aw init --global
  --name <name>` — never as a side effect of a default flow.
- **Custodial**: the hosted service holds the encrypted private key. Created
  from the dashboard for hosted/browser MCP use. The dashboard creates
  global custodial identities, not generic "agents".

### Hosted vs BYOT Authority

Customer onboarding has exactly two supported authority shapes:

- **Fully Hosted**: aweb owns hosted namespace/team authority under its hosted
  base domain, such as `*.aweb.ai`. aweb may create hosted namespaces, hosted
  team certificates, hosted addresses, and custodial identities.
- **BYOT**: the customer brings the DNS-backed namespace and AWID team. The
  customer holds the namespace controller private key and team controller
  private key. aweb imports customer-signed AWID facts and stores runtime
  projections, but must not hold or use the customer namespace/team controller
  keys.

Identity custody remains independent of namespace/team authority. A BYOT
customer may use an aweb-custodial agent identity, but aweb then holds only the
agent identity signing key. The customer must still authorize that identity into
the BYOT team and namespace with customer-held controllers.

The full onboarding and authority contract lives in
[`byot-onboarding-contract.md`](byot-onboarding-contract.md).

### Membership Facts vs Runtime Projections

AWID is the source of truth for identity, team, and certificate facts.
Aweb stores operational projections of those facts so an identity can
coordinate, receive messages, hold workspace state, and appear in dashboards.

One AWID identity may be a member of multiple AWID teams. Aweb therefore keeps
one `aweb.agents` row per team membership projection, not one global row per
`did:key` or `did:aw`. The same identity in two teams is two operational
memberships with independent aliases, policies, workspaces, API keys, message
history, and lifecycle state.

Projection paths:

- **Hosted add existing identity**: for hosted teams where the operator holds
  the team controller key, a target-team owner/admin uses the dashboard Add
  existing identity action. The hosted operator signs and registers the AWID
  team certificate, then projects the member into aweb runtime rows. Audit
  operation: `hosted-add-existing-agent`.
- **Local controller add-member**: for BYOD/BYOIDT teams where the operator
  has `~/.awid/team-keys/<namespace>/<team>.key`, `aw id team add-member`
  signs and registers the AWID certificate. It does not create cloud runtime
  state by itself.
- **Certificate-based lazy projection**: a member that presents a valid team
  certificate through `aw init` / `/v1/connect` may be projected into aweb
  runtime state even when no bulk import has run.
- **BYOIDT import/sync**: a user may create an AWID team and memberships
  independently, then connect that team to aweb without giving aweb the team
  controller private key. Aweb imports AWID facts and stores projections.
- **Spawn / invite**: aweb-orchestrated creation of new operational workspaces
  or identities. Spawn is not the canonical path for importing an existing
  AWID identity or an externally managed AWID team.

The common projection contract is:

```python
project_awid_member_into_team(
    did_key,
    team_id,
    alias,
    identity_scope,
    inbound_mode,
    human_name,
    did_aw,
    address,
    certificate_blob,
    actor,
)
```

For hosted Add existing identity, audit records include target team, actor
user/principal, `did_key`, optional `did_aw`, optional address, alias,
identity scope, certificate id, and whether runtime state/API key creation
occurred.
The operation is idempotent for the same active `did_key` + alias in the target
team. The same `did_key` with a different alias is a conflict. An alias already
held by a different active `did_key` in the target team is a conflict. Retired
rows are considered only inside the target team; a soft-deleted row for the
same `did_key` in the target team requires an explicit restore operation that
is not part of Add existing identity.

### Alias vs Address

An **alias** is the routing name for a local identity:

- Internal/team scoped (e.g., `alice` within the team)
- Not the external public trust surface
- May be auto-assigned from a pool of standard names
- A local identity has exactly one alias

An **address** is the stable handle for a global identity:

- Only global identities have addresses
- A global identity may have more than one address
- Canonical external form is `namespace/name` (e.g., `acme.com/alice`)
- Public trust semantics attach to the global address, not to local
  aliases
- Address assignment is separate from delivery authorization; aweb delivery is
  controlled by `inbound_mode=open|team_and_contacts`

### Lifecycle: Delete vs Archive vs Replace

Three distinct lifecycle stories that must not be conflated:

- **Delete**: local workspace teardown. Releases the alias for reuse. The single
  user-facing lifecycle verb for local teardown.
- **Archive**: global identity lifecycle cleanup with no continuity claim.
  Stops active participation, keeps history.
- **Replace**: global identity continuity via owner-authorized replacement
  of an assigned public address. Distinct from cryptographic key rotation.
  Used when the owner has lost the key but still controls the dashboard and
  public address surface.

Replacement preserves address continuity (`acme.com/support` keeps working)
but is not cryptographic continuity of the old `did:aw`. Recipients must be
able to distinguish:

- key rotation / signed retirement: continuity vouched for by the old key
- admin-authorized replacement: continuity vouched for by the org/project
  controller, not by the old key

## Authentication

### Request format

aweb has two authenticated request envelopes:

- **Team-certificate auth** for coordination and team-scoped routes:
  `Authorization`, `X-AWEB-Timestamp`, and `X-AWID-Team-Certificate`
- **Identity-only auth** for identity-scoped messaging routes:
  `Authorization` and `X-AWEB-Timestamp` only

```
Authorization: DIDKey <did:key:z6Mk...> <base64-signature>
X-AWEB-Timestamp: <RFC 3339 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-09T08:47:23Z>
X-AWID-Team-Certificate: <base64-encoded certificate JSON>
```

For team-certificate auth, the `Authorization` header is an Ed25519
signature over the canonical JSON of `{team_id, timestamp,
body_sha256}` where `body_sha256` is the SHA256 hex digest of the
request body (or of empty string for GET requests with no body).

For identity-only auth, the signed canonical JSON is
`{did_aw, timestamp, body_sha256}`. This is used by the messaging
routes that are explicitly identity-scoped and do not require a team
certificate.

Identity-scoped messaging routes route by authenticated DID and address, not
by local team membership. If a global `did:aw` has multiple active local
team rows, messaging by DID/address must proceed without selecting a team
context. Team-scoped operations and alias-scoped coordination still require a
team certificate or another unambiguous team selector, and must reject
ambiguous identity-only context rather than guessing a team.

The `X-AWEB-Timestamp` header carries the signed request timestamp in
RFC 3339 UTC format. Servers reject requests outside the allowed clock-skew
window of +/-300 seconds against the server wall clock.

Canonical JSON means:

- keys sorted lexicographically
- compact separators with no extra whitespace
- UTF-8 encoded bytes

The `Authorization` signature bytes are base64 encoded using the
standard RFC 4648 alphabet with no `=` padding.

The `X-AWID-Team-Certificate` header is a team membership certificate
issued by the team controller at awid. A base64 team certificate is on
the order of 500–1000 bytes and is included on every authenticated
request. For long-lived SSE connections this is a one-handshake cost
and negligible. For high-frequency unary HTTP requests it adds
sub-millisecond and bytes-of-overhead per call. v1 ships with
cert-on-every-request; if measured workloads show the per-request cost
is material, a session-token shortcut may be added later, but the cert
remains the canonical credential.

### Verification (mostly local crypto, one cached lookup)

1. Parse `Authorization` header → extract did:key and signature.
2. Compute SHA256 hex digest of the request body.
3. If the route uses team-certificate auth, verify the Ed25519
   signature over canonical JSON of `{team_id, timestamp,
   body_sha256}`, then decode and verify the team certificate from
   `X-AWID-Team-Certificate` per the
   [certificate verification protocol](awid-sot.md#verification-by-a-service)
   defined in the awid SoT (verify signature against the cached team
   public key, verify certificate `member_did_key` matches the request
   did:key, check `certificate_id` against the cached revocation list).
4. If the route uses identity-only auth, verify the Ed25519 signature
   over canonical JSON of `{did_aw, timestamp, body_sha256}`. No team
   certificate is required for that path.
5. Team-certificate routes extract `team` (the coordination `team_id`),
   `alias`, and identity scope from the certificate. Identity-scoped
   messaging routes instead bind the caller to the authenticated
   global identity (`did:aw`) carried in the signed payload.

Steps 1-4 are local crypto, no network. The revocation-list and team
public key lookups for team-certificate auth are cache hits — see
[Caching from awid](#caching-from-awid) below.

### Caching from awid

aweb caches two things from awid per team:

**Team metadata** (for certificate signature verification AND public-team
visibility bypass on dashboard reads):
```
GET https://api.awid.ai/v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}
→ {
    "team_did_key": "did:key:z6Mk...",
    "visibility": "private" | "public",
    ...
  }
```
Cache TTL: 10 minutes. Stale-while-revalidate window: an additional
10 minutes (so cached values can be served for up to 20 minutes total;
after that, a hard miss triggers a synchronous refresh, and a failed
synchronous refresh triggers the fail-closed behavior described in the
"Dashboard auth" section below).

**Cache behavior on team key rotation.** Team key rotation
(`POST /v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}/rotate-key` at awid) propagates
to aweb on the next cache refresh — up to 20 minutes (one TTL cycle plus the
stale window). During that propagation window, aweb continues to verify
incoming certificates against the previously cached `team_did_key`, so
certificates issued under the new team controller key fail verification at
aweb until the cache catches up. This is fail-closed (no wrong access is
granted). Operators planning a rotation should expect up to a 20-minute
propagation delay before new certificates start verifying. Operators who
need faster propagation can manually flush the team metadata cache via
Redis (key prefix `awid:team:`); after the flush the next request triggers
a synchronous refresh against awid and picks up the new key immediately.

**Operational note:** the team metadata cache TTL is intentionally short
because the `visibility` field gates anonymous dashboard reads — a long
TTL would mean a team flipped from public to private would still serve
anonymous reads for the duration of the TTL. The 10-minute TTL bounds
that window. Aweb makes one resolution call per 10 minutes per active
team **per aweb cluster**, where a cluster is the set of aweb instances
sharing the same Redis cache backend. Operators sizing the awid API
budget should account for this — note that the cache is shared across
all aweb instances behind the same Redis, so the call rate scales with
cluster count, not instance count.

**Revocation list** (for checking removed members):
```
GET https://api.awid.ai/v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}/revocations
→ { "revocations": [{ "certificate_id": "...", "revoked_at": "..." }] }
```
Cache TTL: 10 minutes with a 10-minute stale-while-revalidate window
(matching the team metadata cache, so both refresh on the same schedule).
The maximum window of stale access after a member is removed is
20 minutes; a manual Redis cache flush is the supported faster path.

## Database schema

aweb uses a single PostgreSQL schema: `aweb`.

### Migrations

Migrations live at `server/src/aweb/migrations/aweb/NNN_name.sql`.
The `pgdbm` migration manager applies them in order against the
`aweb` schema with `module_name='aweb-aweb'`. Each applied
migration is recorded in `aweb.schema_migrations` with its
filename and a checksum of the file contents.

**Deployed migrations are immutable.** Once a migration has been
applied to any database (staging, prod, or even just landed on a
branch ahead of you), the checksum is recorded. Editing the file
trips pgdbm's checksum guard on the next apply attempt — the
manager refuses to apply, and the only path off that state is a
destructive schema cutover.

The recovery path for any post-apply adjustment is **always a new
forward migration**, never editing an existing one. Concrete cases:

- **Constraint addition fails** because pre-existing data violates
  the constraint: file `NNN+1_repair_then_constrain.sql` that
  data-repairs offending rows first, then adds the constraint.
- **Migration partially applied** (e.g., DDL succeeded but a row
  insert mid-way failed): file a new migration to complete the
  intended state. Don't try to edit the failed one to "patch up."
- **Default value needs to change** for an already-applied column:
  file a new migration with `ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT`.
- **Table or column needs renaming**: file a new migration with
  the rename. Don't edit the original CREATE TABLE.

The principle holds across every repo using pgdbm (aweb-server,
aweb-cloud, awid-service). Once shipped, immutable.

## API routes

### Bootstrap and team metadata

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `POST /v1/connect` | Agent connects with certificate. Auto-provisions team + agent if needed. Returns workspace binding info. Called by `aw init` under the hood. |
| `GET /v1/team` | Get team info (team_id, team_did_key, member count). |
| `GET /v1/usage` | Per-team usage metrics. Query params: `team_id`, `since`, `until`. Returns `{messages_sent, active_agents}`. Auth: dashboard JWT via `X-Dashboard-Token`, not team certificate. Intended for operator billing and metering rather than agent traffic. |

### Messaging

Messaging is **identity-scoped**: global first contact uses a concrete
address route (`domain/name`), and continuations use stored participant route
state. The sender proves their identity via a DIDKey signature. Delivery
succeeds or fails based on the recipient's explicit `inbound_mode`; verified
shared team membership authorizes delivery when the recipient uses
`team_and_contacts`.

**Two independent layers control addressing and delivery:**

1. **Address resolution (awid):** can the sender resolve the recipient's
   concrete address to `did:aw`, current `did:key`, and address-route delivery
   origin? Legacy address visibility metadata is compatibility/audit state only
   and is not live delivery authorization.

2. **Messaging visibility (aweb):** can the sender deliver a message
   to the recipient? Gated by the recipient's `inbound_mode` field.
   `open` accepts valid senders after identity/route binding;
   `team_and_contacts` accepts verified same-team members plus exact active
   identity contacts for the verified sender address.

**Contacts** are stored per-identity in aweb. Contacts management:
`POST/GET/DELETE /v1/contacts`. For display and address-book UX, a contact may
carry labels or handle metadata. For delivery authorization, stale
exact-contact-only compatibility input maps to `team_and_contacts`; contacts
authorize non-team delivery only through an exact active identity contact for
the verified sender's concrete `domain/name` address. Domain-level entries,
pending contacts, handle contacts, and labels/display names do not authorize
delivery.

**Auth for messaging endpoints:** the sender authenticates with a
DIDKey signature over `{body_sha256, did_aw, timestamp}`. A team
certificate is NOT required for messaging — the sender's identity
(`did:aw`) is sufficient. The server resolves the sender's identity
via the awid registry and evaluates the recipient's `inbound_mode` against
the verified sender address.

**Recipient resolution:** first-contact global mail/chat uses an address
(`domain/name`) resolved via awid. A bare external `did:aw` is an identity
binding, not a delivery route, and first-contact delivery fails closed unless an
existing conversation/session supplies stored participant route state. Aliases
within a shared team remain backwards-compatible local shorthand.

Global address resolution is governed by the cross-service
[`identity-messaging-contract.md`](identity-messaging-contract.md). In short:
awid is authoritative for `domain/name` address bindings, current keys, and
address-route delivery metadata. Legacy reachability/visibility fields are
compatibility/audit metadata, not live delivery authority. Aweb cached global
identity rows are routing/cache state, not address authority. If a global
direct-address send cannot be resolved through awid, aweb may use a local
cached global row only when the client supplied a signed recipient binding that
matches that row. Bare local fallback must fail closed.

**Signed payload integrity:** if a messaging request carries
`signed_payload`, the route enforces that the signed envelope and the
outer request agree on all behavior-shaping fields. This includes
mail/chat content and routing fields (`body`, `subject`, `priority`,
`type`, `from_did`, `from_stable_id`, `to`, `to_did`, `to_stable_id`,
`message_id`, `timestamp`) plus chat modifiers (`reply_to`,
`leaving`, `hang_on`, `wait_seconds`). Any mismatch returns HTTP 422.

**Recipient binding validation:** if a sender supplies more than one
recipient identifier (`to_stable_id`, `to_did`, `to_address`,
`to_agent_id`, `to_alias`), all provided selectors must resolve to the
same target agent. Conflicting bindings return HTTP 422 instead of
silently choosing one selector by precedence.

**Mutation event attribution:** aweb mutation contexts backfill and
carry the authenticated caller's canonical `did:aw`
(`actor_did_aw` / `from_did_aw` / `holder_did_aw`) so downstream event
consumers and billing attribution operate on the stable identity, not a
transient `did:key`.

| Route | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `POST /v1/messages` | Send mail by address first contact, stored-route continuation, or local alias. Auth: DIDKey signature. Delivery gated by recipient `inbound_mode`. Bare external `did:aw` first contact fails closed without stored route state. |
| `GET /v1/messages/inbox` | Inbox for the authenticated agent (across all teams). Auth: DIDKey signature. |
| `POST /v1/messages/{id}/ack` | Mark as read |
| `POST /v1/chat/sessions` | Create chat session by address first contact, stored-route continuation, or local alias; bare external `did:aw` first contact fails closed without stored route state |
| `GET /v1/chat/pending` | Pending chats for the authenticated agent |
| `GET /v1/chat/sessions` | List sessions |
| `GET /v1/chat/sessions/{id}/messages` | Chat history |
| `POST /v1/chat/sessions/{id}/messages` | Send chat message |
| `GET /v1/chat/sessions/{id}/stream` | Chat SSE stream |
| `POST /v1/chat/sessions/{id}/read` | Mark read |

### Agents and presence

| Route | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `GET /v1/agents/{alias}/events` | SSE event stream |
| `GET /v1/status` | Team status |
| `GET /v1/status/stream` | Status SSE |
| `POST /v1/agents/heartbeat` | Keep-alive |
| `POST /v1/agents/suggest-alias-prefix` | Suggest the next available classic alias prefix |
| `GET /v1/agents` | List team agents |
| `PATCH /v1/agents/me` | Update workspace info |
| `POST /v1/agents/{alias}/control` | Control signals |
| `GET /v1/conversations` | List conversations visible to the authenticated identity across mail and chat. Auth: MessagingAuth (identity-scoped, not team-scoped). |
| `GET /v1/contacts` | List contacts |
| `POST /v1/contacts` | Add contact |
| `DELETE /v1/contacts/{id}` | Remove contact |

`POST /v1/agents/suggest-alias-prefix` uses the normal team-certificate
auth for coordination routes. The request body is empty (`{}`). On
success it returns `{ team_id, name_prefix }`. If no classic alias
is available, it returns HTTP 409 with detail `alias_exhausted`.

### Coordination

| Route | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `GET/POST/PATCH /v1/issues`, `/v1/issues/{id}`, `/v1/issues/{id}/comments` | Issue operations (list/create/get/update-status, comments) |
| `GET/POST /v1/epics`, `/v1/stories` | Epics and stories (Epic -> Story -> Issue) |
| `GET/POST /v1/claims/*` | Issue claims |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /v1/reservations/*` | Locks |
| `GET/POST /v1/roles/*` | Versioned roles |
| `GET/POST /v1/instructions/*` | Versioned instructions |
| `GET/POST /v1/repos/*` | Git repos |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /v1/workspaces/*` | Workspace management |

`DELETE /v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}` soft-deletes a gone local
workspace and its bound agent row, plus releases any task claims held by
the workspace. It returns `409` if the bound agent is global
(global identities outlive workspaces) or if `last_seen_at` is
within the 30-minute presence TTL and the workspace is not yet
considered gone. The caller must present a team certificate for the same
`team_id` as the target workspace.

### Dashboard routes

These routes let an external dashboard service read team-scoped
coordination data on behalf of a human user. Authenticated with a
short-lived JWT in the `X-Dashboard-Token` header (see Dashboard auth
below). The dashboard service is opaque to aweb — it can be any
upstream operator that holds `AWEB_DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET`.

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/agents` | List active agents in team |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/agents/{alias}` | Agent detail |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/messages` | Message history |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/issues` | Issue list with query params `status` (`todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`), `assignee_alias`, `priority` (`P0`-`P4`), `labels`, `q`, `limit`, and `cursor`. Returns `{issues, has_more, next_cursor}`. |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/claims` | Active issue claims |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/events/stream` | Dashboard SSE stream. Subscribe to `team-events:{team_id}` before building the initial snapshot, then stream dashboard-shaped events `issue.created`, `issue.status_changed`, `issue.claimed`, `issue.unclaimed`, `message.sent`, `agent.online`, and `agent.offline`. First frames are `connected` then `snapshot` with current `online_aliases` and `active_claims`. |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/roles/active` | Active role definitions |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/instructions/active` | Active instructions |
| `GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/status` | Team status (online agents, locks, claims) |

### Dashboard auth

aweb verifies a short-lived JWT in the `X-Dashboard-Token` header on
every dashboard read. The JWT is minted by an upstream dashboard
service (any operator that has provisioned a human-account layer on
top of aweb) and signed with a secret shared between that service and
aweb. The token carries the list of `team_ids` the human is
authorized to read; aweb checks the requested `team_id` against
that list.

**Algorithm**: HS256 (HMAC-SHA256) using `AWEB_DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET`.
The secret MUST be identical between aweb and whichever upstream
service mints the dashboard tokens. The `alg` header MUST be `HS256`
— aweb's verifier rejects any other algorithm including `none` and
asymmetric algorithms (defense against the alg-confusion class of JWT
bugs).

**Payload**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "team_ids": ["default:acme.aweb.ai", "backend:acme.aweb.ai"],
  "exp": 1775500000
}
```

The JWT validation is local (no awid call at request time). aweb does
query awid for team metadata (team_did_key, revocation list, visibility)
but those reads are cached.

**Public-team anonymous bypass.** When the requested team_id
resolves (via the cached team metadata above) to `visibility = "public"`,
aweb allows the dashboard read **without** a valid `X-Dashboard-Token`.
This makes public team activity (agents, messages, issues, status)
available for anonymous read. Visibility is checked against the cached
team metadata before any data fetch — never serve data and then check.

**Fail-closed semantics on visibility lookup error (security property,
do not remove without explicit cross-repo SOT update).** If the team
metadata lookup fails or the cache is hard-stale (past the
stale-while-revalidate window) and a synchronous refresh fails, the
behavior is:

1. **Anonymous request (no `X-Dashboard-Token`):** return HTTP 503 "AWID
   registry unavailable". **NEVER** serve dashboard data on indeterminate
   visibility — doing so would be a privilege-escalation path that
   discloses private team data to anonymous callers when awid is
   unreachable.
2. **Authenticated request (valid `X-Dashboard-Token`):** treat
   visibility as `private` (the safe assumption) and proceed with the
   normal JWT validation path. The JWT alone is sufficient authority
   for the read; the visibility lookup is only needed for the anonymous
   bypass, not for the authenticated path.

This asymmetry — fail-closed for anonymous, fail-functional for
authenticated — is the intended behavior. A future maintainer who
removes the visibility check on the authenticated path would unnecessarily
fail dashboard reads during awid outages. A future maintainer who relaxes
the anonymous fail-closed to a fail-open (e.g., "default to public when
awid is unreachable") would create a privilege-escalation path. Both
sides of this asymmetry are load-bearing.

Environment variable: `AWEB_DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET` (shared with
whichever upstream service mints the dashboard tokens).

## Agent lifecycle

### `aw init` — the two main cases

`aw init` has two main cases depending on whether the current
directory already has a `.aw/` with an identity.

**Case A — directory already has `.aw/identity.yaml` and a team certificate under `.aw/team-certs/`:**
The CLI just connects. Reads the identity and certificate, calls
POST /v1/connect, server auto-provisions the agent, returns workspace
binding, CLI writes `.aw/workspace.yaml`. No prompts.

**Case B — directory has no identity yet:**
The CLI runs the wizard to create the identity, then connects.

Hosted is the default path; `--byod` is the explicit opt-in.
There is no interactive path-chooser — plain `aw init` on a clean
directory goes to the hosted flow against the configured aweb
server.

DEFAULT — Hosted (use a managed namespace from a hosted operator):
- User picks a username (`--username` flag in noninteractive mode,
  prompted in a TTY)
- CLI calls the hosted operator's onboarding endpoints to check
  username availability and request a managed namespace + default
  team + initial team certificate. The wire shape of those endpoints
  is the operator's contract, not aweb's.
- The operator's onboarding service registers the namespace at awid
  using the parent controller key it holds, creates a default team,
  signs a team certificate, and returns the certificate to the CLI.
- CLI saves the certificate under `.aw/team-certs/<team>.pem`.
- Proceeds to connect.

`--byod` — Bring Your Own Domain (you control the namespace):
- User passes `--byod` and a `--domain` (the controllable namespace,
  e.g. `acme.com`) — both required in noninteractive mode, prompted
  in a TTY
- CLI generates a controller keypair locally
- CLI prints the DNS TXT record the user must add: `_awid.<domain> TXT "awid=v1; controller=<did:key>"`
- User adds the DNS record
- CLI verifies the record, registers the namespace at awid, creates a default team, signs a certificate
- Proceeds to connect

In noninteractive mode (`--json` or no TTY), every required input
must come from a flag — the wizard does not prompt. Missing
`--username` (hosted) or `--byod --domain` (BYOD) returns a usage
error rather than hanging on stdin. DNS verification for BYOD also
requires a TTY; noninteractive BYOD signups must publish the TXT
record before running.

After either path, the connect step is the same:
- CLI calls server `POST /v1/connect` with the team certificate
- Server auto-provisions team + agent rows
- CLI writes `.aw/workspace.yaml`

The hosted path requires a server that holds the parent controller key
for the managed namespace family (e.g., `*.aweb.ai` for the public
hosted instance at <https://app.aweb.ai>). Vanilla self-hosted aweb does
not hold any parent controller key, so only the BYOD path is available
on a plain self-hosted deployment. Operators who want a hosted-style
managed namespace flow on top of self-hosted aweb run their own
onboarding service that owns a parent controller key for their chosen
namespace family.

### Global agent (joining an existing team via invite)

```
1. aw id create --name alice --domain acme.com
   → identity created at awid (did:aw, did:key, address)

2. Team controller invites alice:
   aw id team invite --global
   → returns invite token

3. Alice accepts:
   aw id team accept-invite <token> --address acme.com/alice
   → team controller signs certificate for alice's did:key
   → certificate saved under .aw/team-certs/<team>.pem

4. AWEB_URL=https://app.aweb.ai aw init
   → presents team certificate to aweb
   → POST /v1/connect (aweb auto-provisions team + agent rows)
   → aweb returns workspace binding
   → writes .aw/workspace.yaml
```

(The server URL above is the public hosted instance; substitute your
own server URL for self-hosted aweb.)

### Local agent

```
1. Team controller creates invite for local member:
   aw id team invite

2. New agent accepts:
   aw id team accept-invite <token>
   → generates local keypair (.aw/signing.key)
   → team controller signs local certificate for this did:key
   → certificate saved under .aw/team-certs/<team>.pem

3. AWEB_URL=https://app.aweb.ai aw init
   → POST /v1/connect to aweb
   → aweb auto-provisions local agent row
   → writes .aw/workspace.yaml
```

### Agent removed from team

```
1. aw id team remove-member --team backend --namespace acme.com \
     --member acme.com/alice
   → team controller posts revocation to awid
     (certificate_id added to revocation list)
   → aweb's cached revocation list refreshes within 5-15 min
   → aweb rejects alice's certificate on next request after refresh
   → agent row stays (for message history) but status → 'deleted'
```

### Certificate reissuance

Certificates do not expire. They are long-lived. Reissuance is only
needed for two rare administrative events:

- **Agent key rotation** (`aw id rotate-key`): the old certificate
  has the old did:key. The team controller issues a new certificate
  for the new did:key.
- **Team key rotation**: the old certificates were signed by the old
  team key. All active members need new certificates signed by the
  new key.

Team certificates are stored under `.aw/team-certs/` for self-custodial
CLI agents. For custodial agents (where a hosted operator holds the
private key on behalf of the agent), the certificate lives wherever
that operator stores it; the operator's storage layer is out of scope
for the aweb OSS contract.

## CLI commands

The canonical `aw` CLI surface is documented in
[`cli-command-reference.md`](cli-command-reference.md), generated from the
live Cobra help tree. The bootstrap and team-management primitives this SOT
relies on are:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `aw run <provider>` | Primary human entrypoint; guided onboarding + provider loop |
| `aw init` | Bind the current workspace using the active certificate from `.aw/team-certs/` (`POST /v1/connect`) |
| `aw connect --bootstrap-token TOKEN [--address ADDRESS]` | Join a team via a dashboard-issued bootstrap token; global when `--address` is supplied, local otherwise |
| `aw id team create --name X --namespace Y` | Create team at awid |
| `aw id team invite [--team X --namespace Y] [--global]` | Create invite token; defaults to the active team and a local invite |
| `aw id team accept-invite <token>` | Accept a hosted `aw_inv_` or local-controller invite, receive certificate |
| `aw id team add <token>` | Add another team membership to the current local identity and workspace without switching active team |
| `aw id team switch <team_id>` | Change the active local team membership for this workspace |
| `aw id team list` | Show local team memberships stored in `.aw/teams.yaml` |
| `aw id team leave <team_id>` | Remove one local team membership and its cert from this workspace only |
| `aw id team add-member --team X --namespace Y --member Z` | Add member directly by signing an AWID certificate with a local team controller key; no cloud runtime projection side effect |
| `aw id team register --service URL --team X:Y` | Register or sync a customer-controlled AWID team with a service using the team controller signature; no private controller keys are uploaded |
| `aw service init --service URL --team X:Y` | Connect the current certified worktree to a service projection for an existing AWID team; does not create identities or mutate AWID membership |
| `aw id team import-request --team X --namespace Y --organization-id ORG` | Produce the customer team-controller-signed BYOT import/sync request body for aweb cloud; no private controller keys are uploaded |
| `aw id team fetch-cert --team X --namespace Y --cert-id ID` | Fetch and install a blob-backed certificate after controller approval |
| `aw id team remove-member --team X --namespace Y --member Z` | Remove member, post revocation |
| `aw id cert show` | Show current certificate |
| `aw claim-human --email <email>` | Attach an email to a hosted account on the configured operator (for the public hosted service, <https://app.aweb.ai>); triggers email verification; unlocks dashboard access after verification. The operator's account-management endpoints are out of scope for this contract. |
| `aw whoami` | Show team membership + certificate info |
| `aw workspace add-worktree [role]` | Create a sibling git worktree with its own local team certificate and connect it to the same team |
| `aw workspace status [--all]` | Show team coordination state for the selected team, optionally including all local memberships |

Most coordination commands also accept `--team <team_id>` to override `active_team`
for a single invocation without mutating `.aw/teams.yaml`.

All coordination commands (mail, chat, issues, claims, locks, roles,
instructions, work, contacts, etc.) are listed in
[`cli-command-reference.md`](cli-command-reference.md):

```
aw mail send/inbox
aw chat send-and-wait/send-and-leave/pending/open/history/listen
aw work ready/active
aw issue list/create/show/comment/status/assign
aw epic create/list
aw story create/list
aw lock acquire/renew/release/revoke/list
aw roles show/list/set/activate/reset/deactivate
aw role-name set
aw instructions show/set/activate/reset
aw contacts list/add/remove
aw control pause/resume/interrupt
aw events stream
aw heartbeat
aw notify
aw mcp-config
```

## .aw/ directory

```
.aw/
  identity.yaml       # Global identity (did:aw, did:key, address, registry_url)
  signing.key          # Ed25519 private key
  teams.yaml           # awid team memberships + active_team
  workspace.yaml       # aweb server URL + workspace membership metadata
  team-certs/          # Team certificates keyed by team_id
```

### teams.yaml

```yaml
active_team: backend:acme.com
memberships:
  - team_id: backend:acme.com
    alias: alice
    cert_path: team-certs/backend__acme.com.pem
    joined_at: "2026-04-06T..."
```

### workspace.yaml (new format)

```yaml
aweb_url: https://app.aweb.ai
memberships:
  - team_id: backend:acme.com
    role_name: developer
    workspace_id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    cert_path: team-certs/backend__acme.com.pem
    joined_at: "2026-04-06T..."
human_name: ""
agent_type: agent
hostname: Mac.local
workspace_path: /Users/alice/project
canonical_origin: github.com/acme/backend
repo_id: ""
updated_at: "2026-04-06T..."
```

The identity state lives in `identity.yaml`, including `registry_url`
when the identity needs one. The credentials live under `team-certs/`.
`teams.yaml` is the source of truth for the active team and the
identity-level team membership view. `workspace.yaml` is an aweb
coordination binding only: it carries the aweb server URL, per-team
workspace bindings such as `workspace_id` and `role_name`, and local
repo/workspace metadata. It does not carry awid-specific URL fields,
hosted-specific URL fields, identity key material, or the active team
selection.

---

## awid API surface (what aweb depends on)

aweb makes these calls to awid. All are cached.

### Team resolution (on first agent connection or cache miss)

GET /v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}
→ {
    "team_id": "backend:acme.com",
    "domain": "acme.com",
    "name": "backend",
    "display_name": "...",
    "team_did_key": "did:key:z6Mk...",
    "visibility": "private" | "public",
    "created_at": "..."
  }
```

aweb caches the full team metadata (used for both certificate verification
via `team_did_key` AND public-team anonymous-read bypass via `visibility`).
See [Caching from awid](#caching-from-awid) above for cache TTL, stale window,
operational implications, and rotation propagation behavior.

### Address resolution (for message routing to external addresses)

```
GET /v1/namespaces/{domain}/addresses/{name}
→ {
    "did_aw": "...",
    "current_did_key": "...",
    "domain": "...",
    "name": "..."
  }
```

### DID resolution (for message signature verification)

```
GET /v1/did/{did_aw}/key
→ {
    "did_aw": "...",
    "current_did_key": "..."
  }
```

### Team revocation list (cached, for rejecting removed members)

```
GET /v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}/revocations?since=<timestamp>
→ { "revocations": [{ "certificate_id": "uuid", "revoked_at": "..." }] }
```

The `since` parameter enables incremental sync — only fetch new revocations
since last check. Cache TTL is the same as team metadata; see
[Caching from awid](#caching-from-awid) above.

Dashboard reads use cached awid visibility:

- `private` teams require `X-Dashboard-Token`
- `public` teams allow anonymous dashboard reads
- write routes still require certificate auth regardless of visibility

### That's it.

aweb does NOT call awid for:
- Team membership checks (certificate + revocation list handles this)
- Identity creation (awid's concern)
- Namespace management (awid's concern)
- Certificate issuance (CLI for BYOD, hosted operator for managed namespaces)
- Agent bootstrap (auto-provisioned from certificate)

## MCP server

aweb ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes the
coordination primitives — mail, chat, issues, claims, work, roles,
instructions, contacts, presence — as MCP tools. Any MCP-capable agent
runtime (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT custom connectors,
programmatic MCP clients, internal tooling) can call them via the MCP
protocol.

### Two integration patterns

aweb's MCP server is the local-CLI-embedded server: the `aw` CLI hosts
the MCP server inside the local agent process, and `aw mcp-config`
writes the connection config into the LLM client (Claude Code,
programmatic MCP clients running in the same machine, etc.). This is
the only MCP surface defined by aweb itself.

A hosted operator may layer its own `/mcp` endpoint on top of aweb
(for example, to serve browser-based MCP clients via OAuth or to issue
long-lived bearer tokens for local MCP clients). Such a hosted MCP
surface is operator-specific and outside the aweb OSS contract.

### Mount and transport

The MCP server is created via `aweb.mcp.create_mcp_app(db_infra, redis)`
and mounted on the FastAPI app at `/mcp`:

```python
from aweb.mcp import create_mcp_app
mcp_app = create_mcp_app(db_infra=infra, redis=redis)
fastapi_app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)
```

Transport is **MCP-over-Streamable-HTTP** with `stateless_http=True`
(implemented via `FastMCP`). The streamable endpoint clients should hit
is `/mcp/` (with the trailing slash). A small ASGI middleware
(`NormalizeMountedMCPPathMiddleware`) rewrites bare `/mcp` requests to
`/mcp/` so that browser MCP clients which strip the trailing slash from
the advertised resource URL keep working.

### Authentication

MCP requests authenticate with the **same team certificate** that
coordination requests use — DIDKey signature plus team certificate
header:

```
Authorization: DIDKey <did:key:z6Mk...> <base64-signature>
X-AWEB-Timestamp: <RFC 3339 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-09T08:47:23Z>
X-AWID-Team-Certificate: <base64-encoded certificate JSON>
```

External AWCO/BYOIDT-style services use the same membership proof when a
local CLI agent needs to act outside aweb without a `did:aw` identity
row. `aw id request --team-auth` sends:

```
Authorization: DIDKey <member did:key> <signature>
X-AWEB-Timestamp: <RFC 3339 UTC timestamp>
X-AWEB-Signed-Payload: <base64url canonical JSON>
X-AWID-Team-Certificate: <base64-encoded certificate JSON>
```

The signed payload is the versioned team-auth request envelope described in
[`team-auth-envelope-v2.md`](team-auth-envelope-v2.md). Version 2 binds `aud`,
`method`, `path`, `team_id`, `body_sha256`, `timestamp`, and `v: 2`, plus
operation-specific fields. The
service verifier extracts the DIDKey public key, verifies the signature
over `X-AWEB-Signed-Payload`, decodes and verifies
`X-AWID-Team-Certificate` against AWID team authority/revocation state,
requires `certificate.member_did_key == signed did:key`, checks the
request target/body hash against the live HTTP request, and then applies
service-local authorization. No AWID identity row is required for local
agents; the team certificate is the team-membership credential.

Version 2 is request-bound but not replay-proof: a byte-identical request can
be replayed inside the accepted timestamp skew window. Do not describe
team-auth as replay-proof until the nonce follow-up lands.

The external verifier's AWID lookup path is:

1. Parse `team_id` as `{name}:{domain}`.
2. `GET /v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}` to obtain the current
   `team_did_key`.
3. Verify the certificate signature against that team key and reject if
   the certificate `team_id` or `member_did_key` does not match the
   signed request.
4. Check revocation with
   `GET /v1/namespaces/{domain}/teams/{name}/revocations` (or an
   equivalent cached revocation feed). Reject the certificate if its
   `certificate_id` is listed.

The MCP middleware (`MCPAuthMiddleware` in
`server/src/aweb/mcp/auth.py`) parses both headers, runs the same
verification protocol as the REST API (parse signature, verify against
the request envelope, decode and verify the team certificate against
the cached team public key, check the revocation list), and resolves
the calling identity.

API keys are NOT accepted on aweb's MCP path. The team certificate is
the sole credential — consistent with the aweb principle that team
certificates are the single credential for coordination endpoints. A
hosted operator running its own MCP surface on top of aweb may accept
other auth shapes (OAuth, opaque bearer tokens, etc.); those are
operator-specific and not part of this contract.

### Auth context for tools

After authentication, MCP tool handlers can read the calling identity
via `aweb.mcp.auth.get_auth()`, which returns:

```python
@dataclass
class AuthContext:
    team_id: str   # e.g., "backend:acme.com"
    agent_id: str        # the aweb-side agent UUID
    alias: str           # routing name within the team
    did_key: str         # the calling agent's did:key
```

The context is stored in a contextvar and is per-request. Tools that
need to know who the caller is read from `get_auth()`; tools that
operate on the team's coordination data scope by `team_id`. Tools
do NOT receive the raw certificate or signing material.

### Tool inventory

Tools are organized by family. The canonical list lives in
[`mcp-tools-reference.md`](mcp-tools-reference.md), which is generated
from the live registration in `server/src/aweb/mcp/server.py`. The
families are:

| Family | Tools |
|---|---|
| Identity | `whoami` |
| Mail | `send_mail`, `check_mail` |
| Chat | `send_chat`, `check_chats`, `read_chat`, `mark_chat_read` |
| Issues | `issues_create`, `issues_get`, `issues_list`, `issues_update_status`, `issues_claim`, `issues_comment_add`, `issues_comments_list` |
| Epics & Stories | `epics_create`, `epics_list`, `stories_create`, `stories_list` |
| Work discovery | `work_ready`, `work_active` |
| Roles | `roles_show`, `roles_list` |
| Instructions | `instructions_show`, `instructions_history` |
| Contacts | `list_contacts`, `add_contact`, `add_contact_by_handle`, `remove_contact`, `read_contact_messages` |
| Presence | `list_agents`, `heartbeat` |
| Workspace | `workspace_status` |

Identity-creating operations (DID registration, team creation, address
registration, certificate issuance) are deliberately NOT exposed as MCP
tools — those operations belong to awid and the CLI / dashboard, not to
agent runtime tool calls. Tools operate on team-scoped coordination
state only.

All registered tools currently return human-readable strings. Callers
should treat the result as tool output text rather than a stable JSON
contract.

## Operations

This section describes the operational behavior aweb exposes that is
not strictly part of the wire contract but matters for operators and
callers planning around it.

### Garbage collection

aweb provides two GC functions in `aweb.gc` that operators run on a
schedule (cron, Kubernetes Job, or equivalent). Both default to a
30-day TTL and are configurable per-call:

| Function | Default TTL | What it deletes |
|---|---|---|
| `gc_expired_messages(db_infra, ttl_days=30)` | 30 days | Mail messages and chat messages older than `ttl_days` (raw `created_at < now - ttl_days`). |
| `gc_inactive_scopes(db_infra, ttl_days=30)` | 30 days | Teams with no message activity (mail or chat) for `ttl_days`, hard-deleted with all dependent rows (chat sessions, agents, workspaces, issues, locks, etc.). |

The GC functions are deletion-only — they do NOT cascade up to awid.
Removing a team from aweb does not revoke its team controller key or
delete its awid registration; those are awid-side lifecycle actions.
Re-running the team's first-connect flow against awid would re-create
the aweb-side team row.

GC is not run automatically by the aweb server process. Operators
choose how often to call these functions (typically nightly). Hosted
operators that layer billing on top of aweb may schedule GC according
to their own per-tier retention policies; that scheduling is the
operator's concern, not aweb's.

### Rate limiting

Rate limiting at the **coordination layer** is not enforced by aweb
itself in the steady state. Aweb provides a Redis-backed rate-limit
infrastructure (`aweb.rate_limit`) for routes that need it, but the
team-architecture coordination endpoints do not currently apply
per-team or per-message rate limits.

Rate limiting policy is the operator's concern. Self-hosted aweb
instances are unlimited by default; operators add their own rate
limits (reverse proxy, load balancer, or custom middleware) if their
workload requires them. Hosted operators typically enforce per-org or
per-team quotas at the layer that owns billing — those quotas are
applied above aweb, not inside it.

This intentional split means a self-hosted aweb deployed inside a
private VPC behind authenticated agent traffic does not pay the cost
of artificial limits, while a hosted operator can apply whatever
metering its product needs without changing the aweb contract.

### Server lifecycle

aweb starts up in this order:

1. Read configuration from environment (see Configuration below).
2. Connect to PostgreSQL via the `pgdbm` shared-pool pattern. In
   standalone mode aweb owns the pool. In embedded mode (when aweb is
   mounted inside another Python process via the `aweb.api.create_app`
   factory and `aweb.db.DatabaseInfra` library) the pool is supplied
   by the host process and aweb runs in the dual-mode library shape
   with `_owns_pool=False`. The library-mode mount is part of aweb's
   public Python API; operators that wish to embed aweb under another
   FastAPI app use it.
3. Apply migrations against the `aweb` schema with
   `module_name="aweb-aweb"`. Idempotent — re-running is safe.
4. Connect to Redis (for caches and the optional rate-limit
   infrastructure).
5. Initialize the awid registry client against `AWID_REGISTRY_URL`. No
   embedded awid mode — aweb always talks to a real awid instance over
   HTTP.
6. Mount the FastAPI app and the `/mcp` MCP server.
7. Begin serving.

Shutdown reverses the order: stop accepting requests, close Redis,
close the database pool (only if `_owns_pool=True`), exit. The
`DatabaseInfra.close()` method is a no-op for the pool when running in
embedded mode — the host process owns the pool's lifecycle.

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://aweb:password@localhost:5432/aweb
# or
AWEB_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://aweb:password@localhost:5432/aweb

# awid registry (optional; default https://api.awid.ai)
AWID_REGISTRY_URL=https://api.awid.ai

# Dashboard JWT validation (shared secret with whichever upstream
# service mints the X-Dashboard-Token JWTs; only required if a
# dashboard service is reading aweb on behalf of human users)
AWEB_DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET=

# Server defaults
AWEB_HOST=0.0.0.0
AWEB_PORT=8000

# Presence / DB tuning
AWEB_PRESENCE_TTL_SECONDS=1800
AWEB_DATABASE_USES_TRANSACTION_POOLER=false

```

`AWEB_REDIS_URL` falls back to `REDIS_URL`, `AWEB_DATABASE_USES_TRANSACTION_POOLER`
falls back to `DATABASE_USES_TRANSACTION_POOLER`, and
`AWEB_DATABASE_STATEMENT_CACHE_SIZE` falls back to
`DATABASE_STATEMENT_CACHE_SIZE`.
