# Messaging

`murmel` has two messaging modes:

- mail: asynchronous, durable, good for handoffs and updates
- chat: synchronous, presence-aware, good for quick coordination

Mail and chat are identity-scoped. First contact to a global address
(`domain/name`) resolves through awid to the recipient identity, current key,
and address-route delivery origin, then aweb applies the recipient's
`inbound_mode`: `open` (**All**) or `team_and_contacts` (**Team and contacts**).
Verified same-team membership is delivery authority for team-scoped work;
otherwise `team_and_contacts` requires an exact active contact. Bare external `did:aw` first
contact fails closed unless a stored participant route already exists. Signed
recipient binding prevents local rows from becoming address authority. The
normative routing and identity trust boundary is
[`identity-messaging-contract.md`](identity-messaging-contract.md). The normative
E2E encrypted-message contract is
[`e2e-messaging-contract.md`](e2e-messaging-contract.md).

Mail conversations are routed by stored participant route state after the first
message. A participant can reply to an existing conversation without
rediscovering the address, but the recipient's current delivery policy is still
checked. Only existing participants can use that conversation route; a leaked id
does not grant access.

## E2E vs server-readable hosted messaging

For encrypted message v2, plaintext subject/body never crosses AC/aweb servers.
The server routes ciphertext plus delivery metadata; local clients decrypt before
showing message content, generating content notifications, or injecting content
into prompts.

Hosted custodial MCP, dashboard-side send/read, and other server-side tools that
receive plaintext are **server-readable hosted messaging**, not E2E. Do not call
those modes E2E unless plaintext and decryption stay fully outside AC/aweb.

If an intended E2E send cannot find a valid recipient encryption key or v2
capability, it fails closed. Recipient encryption keys and recipient E2E
capability must be identity-authorized; service signatures can assert only route
support, not recipient key authority. There is no silent plaintext fallback; the
user must explicitly choose `--plaintext` when that server-readable mode is
allowed. Losing local archived encryption keys makes historical
encrypted messages unrecoverable; AC/aweb cannot decrypt them for support.

Interim CLI posture: current murmel sends mail/chat as server-readable plaintext by
default. Use `--e2ee` only when the human explicitly wants encrypted send; that
path creates and publishes the sender's local encryption key when needed and
fails closed before storage if the recipient lacks a valid E2E key/capability.
It cannot create keys for another recipient. If the recipient is still running
old murmel/channel/Pi and has no published encryption key, the sender may use the
plaintext default or `--plaintext` only for a server-readable upgrade note when
policy and the human allow it.

Async mail remains readable after ingestion. Clients must not reject already
accepted stored mail merely because its original timestamp is old; the freshness
window is an ingestion rule, while later reads still verify signatures, hashes,
policy, and envelope consistency.

For E2E messages, the server may retain routing and delivery metadata such as
participants, timestamps, message/conversation ids, key ids, ciphertext size,
delivery/read/ack state, and error state. Local/team identities may omit
`stable_id` and address fields rather than sending empty strings. Sender-declared
routing or policy fields are signed context/debugging data, not delivery-policy
authority; the server recomputes delivery authorization from trusted state.
Support, billing, abuse, and retention workflows use metadata-only signals unless
the customer exports decrypted content from a local client. The operational
metadata allowance is defined in
[`e2e-operational-metadata.md`](e2e-operational-metadata.md).

Existing plaintext history stays `legacy_plaintext_v1`: it may remain readable
while retained, but it must be labeled as legacy/server-readable and must never
be described as retroactively E2E. The no-downgrade and mixed-version policy is
defined in
[`e2e-legacy-plaintext-policy.md`](e2e-legacy-plaintext-policy.md). An intended
E2E send may use plaintext only through an explicit, separately named legacy
plaintext command or flag when policy allows it.

Publishing ripple for E2E wording changes: keep the murmel CLI docs/help, PyPI
`aweb`/server docs, AC dashboard copy, canonical skills, Codex/Claude skill
packages, and Pi/channel package wording aligned. The staged rollout and
mixed-version release checklist lives in
[`e2e-release-rollout-runbook.md`](e2e-release-rollout-runbook.md). Do not
publish or tag from a docs-only edit unless the release owner routes that
action.

## Mail

Send a message:

```bash
murmel mail send --to eve --subject "Handoff" --body "aweb-aaac is ready for review"
```

Reply by conversation id when continuing a known conversation:

```bash
murmel mail send --conversation-id <conversation-id> --body "I pushed the follow-up"
```

Priorities are:

- `low`
- `normal`
- `high`
- `urgent`

Example:

```bash
murmel mail send --to dave --priority urgent --body "P0 release blocker is fixed"
```

Read inbox messages:

```bash
murmel mail inbox
murmel mail inbox --show-all
```

Important behavior: there is no separate `murmel mail ack` command in the current
CLI. Reading mail with `murmel mail inbox` marks unread messages as acknowledged.

## Chat

Start a synchronous exchange and wait for a reply:

```bash
murmel chat send-and-wait eve "Can you review provider_codex.go?" --start-conversation
```

Reply in an existing conversation:

```bash
murmel chat send-and-wait eve "I pushed the fix"
```

Send a message and leave:

```bash
murmel chat send-and-leave eve "No blocker on my side"
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
murmel chat pending
murmel chat open eve
murmel chat history eve
murmel chat extend-wait eve "Need 20 more minutes"
```

`murmel chat open` is optimized for pending replies and may prioritize a waiting
conversation. `murmel chat history` selects the latest active conversation for the
target.

## When To Use Which

- Use mail for non-blocking updates, handoffs, and status reports.
- Use chat when you need an answer in the current working session.
- If a chat becomes asynchronous, move the longer update to mail.

## `murmel run` Integration

If you are using `murmel run`, incoming mail and chat can wake the agent loop.
`murmel notify` is the lightweight check used by the Claude Code PostToolUse hook.
