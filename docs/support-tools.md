# OSS Support Tools

This page documents the OSS `murmel` support surface: lifecycle semantics,
`murmel doctor`, registry reads, and redacted support bundles. Hosted dashboard
actions are intentionally described only as boundaries here. Cloud support
APIs and operator runbooks live in the cloud support documentation.

## Lifetime Semantics

aweb separates workspace lifetime from identity lifetime.

- A **local identity** is team-local and workspace-bound. It has an alias
  such as `alice`, but no public address or trust-continuity promise.
- A **global identity** is durable. It has a `did:key`, a stable `did:aw`,
  and may hold public addresses such as `acme.com/alice`.
- A **workspace path** is only a local binding. Losing, moving, or deleting a
  path does not prove that a global identity should be deleted, archived,
  replaced, unclaimed, or reassigned.

Local workspace deletion is a lifecycle event. When the server confirms a
gone local workspace, OSS aweb soft-deletes the workspace and bound
local agent row, clears presence, and releases task claims with the normal
unclaim events.

Global identity workspace disappearance is not a lifecycle event. The server
rejects global identity workspace delete/archive attempts in OSS because global
identity lifecycle requires explicit authority and a reviewed lifecycle flow.
Missing local files alone are never enough evidence for archive, replacement,
address reassignment, or task/presence cleanup.

## `murmel doctor`

`murmel doctor` diagnoses local files, identity registry state, workspace/server
connectivity, team membership, coordination, and safe messaging prerequisites.

Common forms:

```bash
murmel doctor
murmel doctor --json
murmel doctor --online
murmel doctor local
murmel doctor registry --online
murmel doctor support-bundle --output support-bundle.json --json
```

Mode behavior:

- Default/auto mode avoids surprise online probes for checks that require
  registry or server calls.
- `--offline` must not contact the network.
- `--online` allows read-only registry/server checks using the caller's local
  credentials. It does not use support, admin, or service bypass authority.

Doctor statuses use the shared support vocabulary:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ok` | The check ran and the state is correct. |
| `info` | The check ran and found acceptable state worth noting. |
| `warn` | The check ran and found degraded or unusual state. |
| `fail` | The check ran and found wrong state requiring action. |
| `unknown` | The check could not run, for example offline mode or dependency unavailable. |
| `blocked` | The check could not run because the caller lacks authority. |

JSON output follows `doctor.v1` today and uses the same status vocabulary as
[`support-contract-v1`](support-contract-v1.md). Support tooling should read
check IDs, statuses, sources, targets, details, fixes, and handoffs as stable
machine-readable fields.

## `murmel doctor --fix`

`murmel doctor --fix` is intentionally bounded.

Allowed local fixes in OSS are conservative caller-authorized repairs:

- Select `active_team` when exactly one unambiguous membership exists.
- Normalize a local workspace `aweb_url` by stripping unsafe URL parts.
- Normalize `identity.yaml` `registry_url` by stripping unsafe URL parts while
  preserving identity continuity fields and signing key material.

Dry-run first:

```bash
murmel doctor --fix --dry-run
murmel doctor --fix --dry-run local.workspace.active_team
```

Apply only root doctor fixes:

```bash
murmel doctor --fix
murmel doctor --fix local.workspace.active_team
```

The fix framework refuses high-impact or sensitive mutations, including:

- global identity delete/archive/replace/retire/reassign
- private key or signing key rewrites
- task unclaim and presence cleanup
- server, registry, dashboard, support, or service-authority mutations

Category subcommands remain diagnostic-only for fix mode unless a future slice
explicitly exposes scoped fixes.

## Registry Read Commands

The awid protocol is registry-agnostic. A registry may be the public awid.ai
service or a BYOD registry discovered through DNS TXT at `_awid.<domain>`.
Registry read output includes `registry_url` so support can see which registry
instance answered.

Read commands:

```bash
murmel id resolve <did_aw> --json
murmel id addresses <did_aw> --json
murmel id namespace <domain> --json
murmel id namespace addresses <domain> --authority anonymous --json
murmel id namespace addresses <domain> --authority did --json
murmel id namespace addresses <domain> --authority namespace-controller --json
murmel id namespace resolve <domain>/<name> --authority anonymous --json
murmel id namespace resolve <domain>/<name> --authority did --json
murmel id namespace resolve <domain>/<name> --authority namespace-controller --json
```

Registry JSON reads use the shared `support-contract-v1` envelope with
`source: "awid"` and `payload.schema: "registry_read.v1"`.

Authority modes:

- `anonymous`: public registry view. `ownership_proof` is `false`.
- `did`: signs with the local `.murmel/signing.key`, emits
  `authority_mode: "did-key"`, and proves only control of that DID key.
- `namespace-controller`: signs with the local namespace controller key and is
  the only current registry read mode that reports `ownership_proof: true`.

Structured registry outcomes return JSON with `payload.status`:

- `ok`: registry returned a record.
- `fail` with `target.not_found`: registry authoritatively returned 404.
- `unknown` with `registry.unavailable`: transport failure or registry
  unavailable.
- `blocked` with an auth error: registry rejected the caller's authority.

These structured registry outcomes are command output, not shell failures.
Usage errors and missing local signing/controller keys still exit nonzero
before contacting the registry.

Public namespace listing is discovery, not ownership proof. Do not use it as
evidence that a caller owns or may mutate a namespace or address.

## Team Certificate Fetch Support

Blob-backed team certificates can be fetched by the certificate subject with:

```bash
murmel id team fetch-cert --namespace <domain> --team <team> --cert-id <certificate_id>
```

If fetch returns that the certificate blob is unavailable or not fetchable,
the registry has an old metadata-only certificate row. Do not reconstruct a
certificate locally and do not mark the install as successful. The remediation
is controller-side reissue:

```bash
murmel id team add-member --namespace <domain> --team <team> --member <domain>/<name>
```

For direct DID approvals, use the values from the member's request:

```bash
murmel id team add-member --namespace <domain> --team <team> \
  --did <did:key> --alias <alias> \
  --global --did-murmel <did:aw> --address <domain>/<name>
```

`add-member` prints the new `certificate_id` and a fetch command for the
member. After confirming the new blob-backed certificate works, revoke stale
metadata-only rows so they no longer appear as active membership records:

```bash
murmel id team remove-member --namespace <domain> --team <team> --member <domain>/<name>
```

When inspecting registry state, treat records with `revoked_at` as historical
audit rows. Treat active records with no blob as pre-fix rows requiring
reissue. The team controller private key must remain on the controller machine;
support should ask the controller owner to reissue rather than requesting or
moving controller key material.

## E2E encrypted message support boundary

For encrypted message v2, support tools follow the metadata-only operational
contract in [`e2e-operational-metadata.md`](e2e-operational-metadata.md). Support
may inspect message ids, conversation ids, sender/recipient identity metadata,
routes, key ids, ciphertext hashes/sizes, delivery/read/ack state, and
verification/decryption error categories. Support must not inspect or request
server-side plaintext subject/body/chat text for E2E messages.

If content debugging is required, the customer or agent must export decrypted
content from a local client and provide it intentionally as a support attachment.
Do not request private encryption keys or archived encryption keys. Losing
archived local encryption keys makes historical encrypted messages
unrecoverable; AC/aweb cannot recover them.

Hosted custodial MCP, dashboard-side compose/read, and other server-side tools
are server-readable hosted messaging, not E2E. Keep support runbooks and user
copy explicit about which mode produced a message before discussing recovery or
content visibility.

## Support Bundles

`murmel doctor support-bundle --output <file> --json` writes a redacted JSON bundle
that can be shared with support. Offline generation works and preserves the
same no-surprise network behavior as the selected doctor mode.

The bundle may include:

- doctor output and checks
- non-secret platform metadata
- non-secret `.murmel` metadata such as team IDs, aliases, DID/address fields,
  lifetime, custody, and parsed certificate metadata
- E2E operational metadata such as message ids, conversation ids, key ids,
  ciphertext hashes/sizes, delivery state, and verification/decryption error
  categories
- redaction paths and reasons
- narrow request IDs from structured error details when available

The bundle must not include:

- private keys, signing key contents, encryption private keys, or archived
  encryption keys
- API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, or auth headers
- raw team certificate blobs, signatures, or hosted encrypted private key
  material
- E2E plaintext subject/body/chat text, previews, summaries, embeddings, or
  content-derived support notes
- URL userinfo, query secrets, fragments, request bodies, or arbitrary registry
  response bodies

Before writing the output file, the bundle is redacted in memory and scanned
for known secrets. If the final scan finds a known secret, the command fails
without writing a partial bundle.

## High-Impact Handoffs

Doctor may emit `handoff` guidance for actions it will not perform. These are
review prompts, not automatic repairs.

Examples:

- `persistent_lifecycle_review`: global archive/delete/replace requires
  external authorized review; missing local state alone is not sufficient.
- `persistent_identity_registry_repair_review`: if the local DID key is valid,
  caller-authorized DID registration or registry repair is preferred before
  replacement. When local caller authority is present, the explicit command is
  `murmel id register`.
- `managed_address_repair_review`: address repair requires namespace authority.
  Repair is first-line when the existing DID key is valid.
- `namespace_controller_recovery_review`: BYOD namespace recovery requires the
  namespace-controller owner. Doctor does not recover or rotate controller keys.
- `suspected_key_mismatch_review`: investigate key mismatch before rotate,
  replace, or registry repair.

Hosted-only dashboard actions must be labeled as hosted-only and conditional
on hosted authority. OSS doctor does not perform cloud archive, replacement,
managed-address repair, service cleanup, support bypass, or dashboard actions.
