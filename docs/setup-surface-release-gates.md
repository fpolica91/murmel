# CLI setup surface release gates

Run these gates before releasing changes that affect `murmel` team, identity,
workspace setup, bootstrap compatibility, skills, or resource-pack templates.

## Fast setup-surface gate

```bash
scripts/check-setup-surface.sh
```

This checks:

- generated CLI reference is current;
- resource-pack manifests and paths are valid;
- root help still exposes the intended command buckets;
- `murmel agents` remains marked obsolete/legacy compatibility;
- no-source bootstrap/provision failures occur before layout mutation;
- hosted bootstrap failures roll back newly-created `agents/` layouts when no
  `.murmel` identity state exists;
- hosted bootstrap failures preserve layouts that contain `.murmel` key state;
- resource-pack role application stays novice-friendly through `murmel roles add`.

## Full CLI gate

```bash
scripts/regenerate-cli-reference.sh --check
scripts/check-resource-packs.sh
cd cli/go && go test ./cmd/aw
```

Use this before pushing or asking for review on CLI behavior changes.

## Manual review checklist

- Top-level `murmel --help` keeps these buckets visible:
  - Workspace Setup;
  - Identity;
  - Messaging & Network;
  - Coordination & Runtime;
  - Obsolete / Legacy Compatibility;
  - Utility.
- Everyday setup commands are prominent: `murmel init`, `murmel team`, `murmel workspace
  connect`, `murmel check`, `murmel workspace status`, `murmel whoami`.
- Protocol/admin commands use protocol/admin language, especially BYOT
  namespace/team controller operations.
- `murmel agents bootstrap`, `provision`, `add`, `add-worktree`, and related layout
  commands are compatibility/legacy, not the hosted happy path.
- Compatibility commands do not overwrite or delete `.murmel` identity state,
  signing keys, encryption keys, namespace controller keys, or team controller
  keys.
- Any command that spans more than one authority boundary has a dry-run, a
  preflight, rollback, or explicit recovery path.
- Public docs and dashboard copy do not teach bootstrap-era templates as the
  product center.
- Resource-pack templates keep canonical resources harness-neutral and do not
  include DIDs, certificates, aliases, `.murmel` state, generated work symlinks, or
  canonical `CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth.

## Review handoff

When requesting review, include:

- commit range;
- commands run;
- whether generated CLI reference changed;
- whether bootstrap/recoverability tests changed;
- any hosted vs BYOT authority decision that was deferred.
