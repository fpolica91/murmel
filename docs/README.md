# aweb docs

This directory holds the canonical protocol, identity, and user material for
the public `aweb` repo.

Public documentation should live under `https://aweb.ai/docs/`. Agent-facing
Markdown is served as `https://aweb.ai/docs/<name>.md`, and the human-readable
HTML rendering is served as `https://aweb.ai/docs/<name>/`.

## Source of truth

These documents define the system:

- [aweb-sot.md](aweb-sot.md): the implementation
  spec for the `aweb` server and `murmel` CLI under the awid teams architecture,
  including the conceptual taxonomy (agent, workspace, identity, alias,
  address, lifecycle)
- [awid-sot.md](awid-sot.md): the awid
  service spec for namespaces, addresses, the DID registry, teams, and
  membership certificates
- [identity-messaging-contract.md](identity-messaging-contract.md): the
  cross-service contract for identity-scoped mail/chat, address-route first
  contact, recipient binding, and local fallback rules
- [e2e-messaging-contract.md](e2e-messaging-contract.md): the normative
  encrypted message v2 envelope, cryptographic binding, no-downgrade, and
  metadata-leakage contract
- [e2e-operational-metadata.md](e2e-operational-metadata.md): metadata-only
  usage, billing, abuse, retention, support, and admin tooling contract for v2
  E2E messages
- [e2e-legacy-plaintext-policy.md](e2e-legacy-plaintext-policy.md): legacy
  plaintext, explicit plaintext escape hatch, no-downgrade, and mixed-version
  compatibility policy for E2E rollout
- [e2e-release-rollout-runbook.md](e2e-release-rollout-runbook.md): release
  sequencing, mixed-version matrix, observability, and rollback checklist for
  encrypted message v2 rollout
- [global-local-identity-routing.md](global-local-identity-routing.md):
  supporting SOT for the shipped route-level global/local messaging contract
  and the legacy reachability/conversation-auth cleanup path
- [product-authority-sot.md](product-authority-sot.md): supporting SOT for
  identity custody, addressability, team authority, runtime hosting, app
  portability, and the supported terminal/browser composition paths
- [byot-onboarding-contract.md](byot-onboarding-contract.md): the product and
  engineering contract for the two supported onboarding shapes: Fully Hosted
  and BYOT
- [cli-setup-surface-sot.md](cli-setup-surface-sot.md): supporting SOT for
  the `murmel` team/identity/setup command taxonomy: everyday intents, agent
  primitives, protocol/admin primitives, and obsolete/legacy compatibility
- [team-blueprints-sot.md](team-blueprints-sot.md): product SOT for team
  blueprints — repos of souls, roles, skills, and playbooks that an agent
  uses to create a team in the human's repo; defines the souls/instances
  model, vocabulary, target layout, and blueprint contents
- [resource-pack-template-contract.md](resource-pack-template-contract.md):
  supporting SOT for new-design templates that package harness-neutral roles,
  instructions, playbooks, skills, and adapters without identity/workspace state;
  see `resource-packs/coord-workflows` and `resource-packs/company-surfaces`
  for successor resource packs to the bootstrap-era templates
- [setup-surface-release-gates.md](setup-surface-release-gates.md): release
  checklist and regression gates for the primitive-first setup surface
- [bootstrap-layout-contract.md](bootstrap-layout-contract.md): legacy/
  compatibility contract for the in-repo `agents/` bootstrap convention and
  generated agent-home layout. The current setup-surface product taxonomy is
  [cli-setup-surface-sot.md](cli-setup-surface-sot.md).
- [a2a.md](a2a.md): product contract for exposing aweb agents through A2A,
  AWID publication assertions, gateway boundaries, and outbound `murmel a2a`
  behavior
- [a2a-awid-publication-contract.md](a2a-awid-publication-contract.md):
  normative AWID A2A publication and bridge-delegation assertion contract
- [a2a-release-runbook.md](a2a-release-runbook.md): release sequencing, live
  verification, site-copy gates, and rollback checklist for the A2A gateway
  product slice

server startup details. These docs focus on day-to-day user journeys after you
have a working `murmel` binary and server.
