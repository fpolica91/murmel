# Support Contract v1

Shared JSON vocabulary for `murmel doctor` output, `murmel id` registry
read commands, and cloud support endpoints. This is the
machine-readable contract that lets humans and agents parse output
from any of these tools without learning per-tool field names.

**Registry agnosticism.** The awid protocol is one thing; awid.ai
is one implementation. Registries are discovered via DNS TXT at
`_awid.<domain>` or via `identity.yaml`. Nothing in this contract
assumes awid.ai specifically. Payloads that cite a registry MUST
include the `registry_url` that served the call so callers can see
which registry instance answered.

The mental-model companion is
[`ac/docs/support-tools.md`](https://app.aweb.ai/docs/support-tools)
(cloud repo). The implementation plan is
[`ac/docs/support/agent-lifetime-support-epic.md`](https://app.aweb.ai/docs/support/agent-lifetime-support-epic).
This doc is the byte-level contract those docs assume.

## Scope

- **OSS `murmel doctor`** output (JSON + human).
- **`murmel id` registry read commands** (resolve, addresses, namespace
  state/addresses/resolve — any awid-protocol registry, not only
  awid.ai).
- **Cloud support read endpoints** under `/api/v1/admin/support/…`.
- **Cloud lifecycle dry-run output** (`repair-managed-address`,
  `replace-agent`, `archive-agent` dry-runs).

Write operations emit an audit record whose JSON shape is covered
in **AC-04**, not here.

## Envelope

Every response (single-shot tool output or endpoint body) wraps
its payload in an envelope. The envelope carries **transport and
identity metadata only** — the minimal set of fields every
response needs regardless of payload shape. Payload-specific
semantics (including status) live inside `payload` under the
appropriate schema. This boundary is strict:

- The envelope MUST carry exactly the fields listed below. No more.
- `status` is NOT an envelope field. It is a payload-schema concern
  and different payload schemas may define it differently (see
  `registry_read.v1` single-fact status vs `doctor.v1` per-check
  status). Consumers read status from the payload.
- New payload schemas MUST NOT promote their status into the
  envelope. If a schema wants a rollup for convenience, that
  rollup belongs in the payload, not above it.

```json
{
  "version": "support-contract-v1",
  "source": "aweb | awid | aweb-cloud | local",
  "authority_mode": "anonymous | did-key | namespace-controller | team-controller | support | user | user-admin",
  "authority_subject": "<did:key | user id | support actor id>",
  "authoritative": true,
  "generated_at": "<RFC 3339 UTC, millisecond precision>",
  "request_id": "<string; echo of incoming id or server-generated>",
  "target": {
    "type": "agent | workspace | team | address | did | namespace | identity",
    "identifier": "<canonical identifier of the target>",
    "label": "<human-readable label, optional>"
  },
  "redactions": ["<dotted JSON path of any redacted field>", "..."],
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

Field contracts:

- **`version`**: literal string `"support-contract-v1"`. Version
  bumps are not breaking for the envelope; payload shape changes
  go under per-tool schemas.
- **`source`**: the authoritative system for the *payload*. A cloud
  endpoint returning awid registry data uses `source: "awid"` (the
  protocol name, not an implementation URL); a cloud endpoint
  returning its own operational state uses `source:
  "aweb-cloud"`; doctor checks that observe local files use
  `source: "local"`. When `source: "awid"`, the payload MUST
  include `registry_url` naming the registry instance that served
  the call.
- **`authority_mode`**: how the caller was authenticated. `anonymous`
  means no caller credential. `did-key` is a DIDKey signature.
  `namespace-controller` and `team-controller` are controller-key
  signatures. `support` and `user-admin` are hosted-operator roles.
  `user` is a human-held authority lower than admin.
- **`authority_subject`**: the concrete identifier corresponding to
  `authority_mode`. For `anonymous`, omit or set to `null`.
- **`authoritative`**: `true` if the payload is served from its
  source of truth. `false` if it's a cached or derived projection
  — in that case the payload MUST also state the originating
  source as a nested field so the caller can fetch fresh.
- **`generated_at`**: wall clock. Used for cache freshness decisions.
- **`request_id`**: set by the server or echoed from the client's
  `X-Request-ID` header. Always present. Support audit trails
  reference this.
- **`target`**: what the response is *about*. If the response is a
  list, `target` describes the scoping entity (e.g. the team
  whose agents are listed). Per-item targets live inside `payload`.
- **`redactions`**: every field that was in the data model but
  omitted from output. Dotted JSON path syntax
  (`"payload.agent.signing_key_enc"`). If nothing is redacted,
  empty array — NOT null, NOT omitted.

## Status vocabulary (payload-level)

Status is a payload concern, not an envelope concern. Each payload
schema decides where in its payload the status lives and which of
the six values it uses. The values themselves are shared across
all schemas that report status:

```
ok       — the operation ran and the state is correct.
info     — the operation ran; state is acceptable but worth noting.
warn     — the operation ran; state is degraded or unusual; not broken.
fail     — the operation ran; state is wrong; action required.
unknown  — the operation could not run (offline, dependency unreachable,
           insufficient input). Never a claim about state.
blocked  — the operation could not run because the caller lacks authority.
           Distinct from `unknown` so the next-step guidance is
           correct.
```

Not every schema uses every value. `registry_read.v1` uses only
`ok | fail | unknown | blocked` because reads are single facts
where `info` and `warn` do not apply. `doctor.v1` uses all six
because per-check semantics cover the full range.

Order from best to worst (for rollup badges): `ok < info < warn <
fail < unknown < blocked` — i.e. `blocked` outranks `fail` because
an unknown-authority state is more ambiguous than a known failure.

## Payload schemas

Per-tool payload shapes are named schemas nested under the
envelope `payload` field. Known schemas in v1:

- **`registry_read.v1`** — response shape for `murmel id` registry
  read commands (resolve-key, list-did-addresses, namespace
  addresses, resolve-address, namespace-state). MUST include:
  - `status` — one of `ok | fail | unknown | blocked`. This is
    the single-fact status of the read; consumers read it from
    `payload.status`, never from the envelope.
  - `registry_url` — the registry instance that served the call.
  - `operation` — the read op (matches command name).
  - `target` — the requested identifier (did_aw, domain,
    domain/name).
  - `ownership_proof: false` for anonymous/public views — prevents
    public listing being misread as ownership evidence.
  - One typed raw registry field: `did_key`, `addresses`,
    `address`, or `namespace` — populated when `status == "ok"`.
  - `error` — populated when `status` is not `ok`, with a stable
    dotted code from the error-codes list.
- **`doctor.v1`** — per-check entries (see Per-check structure
  below).
- **`audit.v1`** — support audit records (defined by AC-04,
  referenced here for completeness).

New payload schemas may be added without bumping the envelope
version; consumers MUST handle unknown `payload.schema` values
gracefully.

## Per-check structure (doctor output)

Each entry under `payload.checks[]` for an `murmel doctor` run:

```json
{
  "id": "<stable.dotted.id>",
  "status": "ok | info | warn | fail | unknown | blocked",
  "source": "aweb | awid | aweb-cloud | local",
  "authority": "<mode used by this specific check>",
  "target": { "type": "...", "identifier": "...", "label": "..." },
  "authoritative": true,
  "message": "<one-line human summary>",
  "detail": { "<arbitrary diagnostic JSON>" },
  "next_step": {
    "kind": "run_command | open_url | contact_support | none",
    "command": "<shell command, when kind == run_command>",
    "url": "<URL, when kind == open_url>",
    "summary": "<one-line what this next step does>"
  },
  "fix": {
    "available": false,
    "safe": false,
    "authority_required": "<enum from authority_mode>",
    "apply_command": "<shell command>",
    "refusal_reason": "<string if not available or not safe>"
  }
}
```

- `id` is stable across releases. Format:
  `<category>.<subcategory>.<name>` with dots; lowercase snake_case
  within segments. Example: `local.workspace.signing_key_present`.
- `message` is ≤120 chars, human-readable, no secrets.
- `detail` may contain structured diagnostics. Any field in here
  that was redacted must appear in the envelope `redactions` list.
- `fix.available = true` means the doctor has a mechanical repair.
  `fix.safe = true` means the caller can apply it without escalating
  authority. If `fix.available = false`, `refusal_reason` must
  explain why.

## Per-target reference shapes

For cross-tool references, use these stable shapes:

**Agent**:
```json
{"type": "agent", "identifier": "<agent_id UUID>", "label": "<alias>"}
```

**Workspace**:
```json
{"type": "workspace", "identifier": "<workspace_id UUID>", "label": "<path or host>"}
```

**Team**:
```json
{"type": "team", "identifier": "<canonical team id: name:domain>", "label": "<display name>"}
```

**Address**:
```json
{"type": "address", "identifier": "<domain/name>", "label": "<domain>/<name>"}
```

**DID**:
```json
{"type": "did", "identifier": "<did:aw:...>", "label": "<did:key:... or null>"}
```

**Namespace**:
```json
{"type": "namespace", "identifier": "<domain>", "label": "<domain>"}
```

## Error responses

On 4xx/5xx, the envelope still applies; payload is an error object:

```json
{
  "version": "support-contract-v1",
  "source": "...",
  "authority_mode": "...",
  "generated_at": "...",
  "request_id": "...",
  "target": { ... or null },
  "redactions": [],
  "payload": {
    "error": {
      "code": "<stable.dotted.code>",
      "message": "<one-line human summary>",
      "detail": { "<optional structured context>" },
      "next_step": { ... same shape as checks[].next_step }
    }
  }
}
```

Error codes are stable. First-version codes both repos should agree on:

- `auth.unauthenticated`
- `auth.forbidden`
- `auth.authority_insufficient`
- `target.not_found`
- `target.ambiguous`
- `state.stale`
- `state.inconsistent`
- `registry.unavailable`
- `registry.conflict`
- `operation.refused.high_impact`
- `operation.refused.authority_mismatch`
- `operation.refused.dry_run_only`
- `internal.unexpected`

## Contract tests

Both repos land a shared test helper that validates response bytes
against this contract. Suggested location:

- **aweb**: `cli/go/internal/supportcontract/v1_test.go` (Go) and
  `server/src/aweb/support_contract/v1_test.py` (Python).
- **ac**: `backend/tests/support_contract_v1_test.py`.

Helper checks:
- Envelope has all required fields.
- `version == "support-contract-v1"`.
- `redactions` is a list (possibly empty), not null.
- `generated_at` is RFC 3339 UTC with millisecond precision.
- For doctor outputs, each check's `status` is one of the six
  values; each has a stable `id`.
- Error envelopes carry a code from the approved list.

## Versioning

This is v1. Breaking changes bump to v2 and are advertised via a
top-level `version` field. Additive changes (new enum values, new
next_step kinds) are allowed within v1 as long as consumers handle
unknown values gracefully (log and treat as the worst of the
neighboring statuses, or as a no-op for next_step kinds).
