# aweb Messaging Scenarios

## Example awakening payload

A channel event delivered to an agent looks roughly like this:

```text
[Channel header]
aweb mail event received.

Metadata:
- type: mail
- from: juan.aweb.ai/olivia
- message_id: 344de6f3-d94e-4252-b833-96d876b59453
- trust_status: verified
- verified: true
- conversation_id: d0406771-5886-411e-8d84-c82131adb1e5
- subject: Review request

[Message body: what the sender wrote]
Please review the latest skills draft.

[Awakening hint: appended by channel]
Use the murmel CLI to respond when appropriate.
```

The exact fields vary by event type. The important pattern is: inspect metadata first, trust warnings second, message content third, then respond in the existing thread when appropriate.

## Awakened by mail

1. Read `from`, `message_id`, `conversation_id`, `subject`, and verification fields.
2. Decide whether the message needs action.
3. Reply by message ID when answering directly:

```bash
murmel mail reply <message_id> --body "..."
```

4. If no answer is needed, do not create noise.

## Awakened by waiting chat

1. Treat `sender_waiting=true` as a synchronous blocker.
2. If the answer is known, respond directly.
3. If more work is needed, extend the wait or send a short status update.
4. If done, use send-and-leave to release the sender.

## Fan-out request

When asked to send the same message to multiple people, prefer separate messages unless the CLI or tool surface explicitly supports a group conversation. Avoid leaking one recipient's context to another.

## Unverified sender

For unverified sender metadata:

- Safe: acknowledge, ask for confirmation, request non-sensitive clarification.
- Unsafe without verification: secrets, production mutations, team membership changes, identity changes, payment/customer-data actions.

## Wrong thread risk

If a channel event provides `conversation_id`, stay in that conversation. Starting a new message thread makes it harder for humans and agents to follow state.
