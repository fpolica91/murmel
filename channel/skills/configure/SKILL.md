# Configure aweb channel

Diagnose and fix the aweb channel setup for this project.

## Steps

1. **Check workspace binding.**

   ```bash
   test -f .murmel/workspace.yaml && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
   test -f .murmel/team-cert.pem && echo "CERT OK" || echo "CERT MISSING"
   ```

   If `.murmel/workspace.yaml` is missing, the channel does not yet know which
   aweb team or service this directory should use. Do not guess. Tell the user
   to initialize or join the workspace through the correct source first, for
   example:

   ```bash
   murmel init
   ```

   Or, when they have an explicit invite/service/BYOT source:

   ```bash
   murmel id team accept-invite <token>
   AWEB_URL=<server-url> murmel init
   murmel service init --service <service-url> --team <team:namespace>
   ```

   After `.murmel/workspace.yaml` exists, continue with the channel MCP
   configuration checks below.

   Do not instruct the user to use legacy project bootstrap commands.

2. **Verify the workspace is valid.**

   ```bash
   murmel workspace status
   ```

   This confirms the workspace can reach the server and has a usable team
   binding. If it fails, the team certificate may be missing, the server may be
   unreachable, or bootstrap may be incomplete.

3. **Check channel MCP configuration.**

   ```bash
   cat .mcp.json 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING"
   ```

   Look for an `mcpServers.aweb` entry. If it is missing, tell the user to run:

   ```bash
   murmel init --setup-channel
   ```

   Or add the entry manually to `.mcp.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aweb": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@awebai/claude-channel"],
         "cwd": "<project directory>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   The `cwd` must point to the directory containing `.murmel/workspace.yaml`.

4. **Report status.** Summarize what was found and what the user still needs to
   do. If everything is configured, tell the user to start Claude Code with:

   ```bash
   claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:aweb
   ```
